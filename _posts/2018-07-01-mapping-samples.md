The mapping samples contain the configuration for both our products, snapADDY Grabber and snapADDY VisitReport.
If you are using only one of our products you can delete the section in the mapping you don't need.

snapADDY Grabber is mapped in the "defaultExport"-section.  
snapADDY VisitReport is mapped in the "visitreport"-section.
