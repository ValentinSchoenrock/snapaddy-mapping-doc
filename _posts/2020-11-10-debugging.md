Debugging is very important step in the mapping process. The snapADDY Grabber has a powerful debug console, that can be opened by pressing "F12" in the Grabber window. This opens a new DevTool debug console window.
 
You can see what will be exported to the CRM by looking at the "**EntityMapping**" logs. Every entity in the mappings should appear in the Console. Expand the log to see what the mapping for the entity returned (**Mapping returned**).
