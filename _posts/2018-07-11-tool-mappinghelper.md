The Mapping Helper is needed to get the mapping-IDs of templates and questions. You will need this for VisitReport Mappings.
You can get your copy here: [Download](https://github.com/snapADDY/snapaddy-mapping-doc/raw/master/files/MappingHelper.zip)*

You will need an API Key to use the Mapping Helper. To get yours, go to your [profile settings](https://app.snapaddy.com/profile-update) and scroll down to API Token to generate one.

**The Mapping Helper is currently only supported for Windows operating systems.*
